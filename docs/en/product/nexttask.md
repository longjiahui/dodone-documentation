# Recurring Tasks

Recurring tasks in dodone may differ slightly from other productivity tools. More precisely, they are "next-time tasks." Future recurring tasks are not pre-created; instead, you are prompted to create the next task when you complete the current one. For example, if you set up a daily recurring task, completing it will prompt you to create the next task, with the suggested time set to the following day.

If you set up a recurring task on a parent task, the system will automatically copy all subtasks when prompting to create the next task.

Both parent and child tasks can have subtasks, and all follow the rules described above.

## Recurring Task Properties

- a: Repeat every N days
- b: Rest interval for each cycle. If set to 2, the first cycle rests 1 day, the second doesn't rest; if set to 3, the first cycle rests 1 day, the second rests 2 days, the third doesn't rest.
- endDate: End date. After this date, the system will no longer prompt to create the next task.
