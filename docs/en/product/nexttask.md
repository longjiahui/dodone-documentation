Recurring tasks in dodone may differ from other software tools. More accurately, it's "next task". Future recurring tasks are not pre-created, but rather prompted for creation when you complete the current task. For example, if you set a daily recurring task, when you complete the task, you'll be prompted to create the next task with the date set to the next day.

If you set recurrence on a parent task, when prompted to create the next task, subtasks will be automatically copied.

Both parent and child tasks can have recurrence settings, and all follow the rules described above.

## Recurring Task Properties

- a - Recur every N days
- b - Rest interval per cycle. If set to 2, the first time rests 1 day, the second time doesn't rest; if set to 3, the first time rests 1 day, the second time rests 2 days, the third time doesn't rest.
- endDate - End date. After the end date, no more prompts to create next tasks.
