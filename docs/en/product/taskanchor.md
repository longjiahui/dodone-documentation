# Task Anchor

When you create 3, 4 layers, or even more levels of subtask hierarchies, task management can become cumbersome. Creating anchors can solve this problem. Anchors are similar to bookmarks - after adding an anchor, you can directly access the anchored task from the group.

## Operations
