# Task List Features

The task list has some convenient features. After using filter functions, the task list order cannot be manually adjusted and can only use automatic sorting, but you can set sorting rules.

## Show Only Leaf Node Tasks

Show only tasks without subtasks. This filters out the bottom-level tasks, which are typically the smallest execution units.

## Sort by Priority

Quickly sort tasks by priority. Only available when not using automatic sorting.

## Task Sorting in Automatic Sort Mode

In automatic sort mode, there is a sorting settings button. Click the button to set ascending/descending order, and select from the dropdown to change the sorting dimension.
