The task list has some convenient features. After using the filter function, the task list order cannot be manually adjusted and only automatic sorting can be used, but sorting rules can be configured.

## Show Only Leaf Node Tasks

Show only tasks without subtasks. This filters out the bottom-level tasks, which are usually the smallest executable units.
